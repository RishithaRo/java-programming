// Polymorphism
/*
polymorphism means many ways to execute methods .
Polymorphism is classified into 2 types.
They are 
    1. Compile-time Polymorphism
    2. Run-time Polymorphism
    
==> Compile-time Polymorphism (method Overloading)
            --> If a class has multiple methods by same name, It is called as compile time Polymorphism
            --> It increase the readability of a program.
        Compile time polymorphism can be achieved 
            1) By changing the number of arguments
            2) By changing Datatype.
            
==> Run-time Polymorphism (method Overriding)
            --> If the child class has the same method declared in the parent class, It is called as method Overriding.
        Rules for creating method Overriding
            1) Method name must be same name in both parent and child class.
            2) Methods must have same parameters
            3) It should be achieved by inheritance method.( By extends keyword).
